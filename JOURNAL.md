## 11/2/2025 - Brainstormed + Designed Chassis (2/3 done)   

My partner and I started by developing a "brain-dump," which resulted in an incomplete CAD which laid out the foundation for what we wanted to make. We were heavily inspired by "Blink," a 3lb robot that has fought at NHRL. 
Brainstorming CAD:

After defining our list of constraints, which included: 
- Chassis out of UMHW (Side) and Nylon (Back)
- 4WD, Direct Drive Rear Drive + Belted Dead Shaft Front Drive
- Belted Weapon Drive, Asymmetrical Single Toothed Weapon
- Swappable Wedge and Forks for fights
- CF Top and Bottom Plates 

We have yet to decide: 
- Weapon Motor
- Drive Motor (Used JCR Modified Dartbox Pro (Viper) as an example) 
- Buy Pre-cut or Machine Ourselves (Whichever is cheaper)

CAD Progress: 
- Incomplete Chassis and Uprights

Both of us worked 4.5 hours
