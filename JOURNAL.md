## 11/2/2025 - Brainstormed + Designed Chassis (2/3 done)   

My partner and I started by developing a "brain-dump," which resulted in an incomplete CAD which laid out the foundation for what we wanted to make. We were heavily inspired by "Blink," a 3lb robot that has fought at NHRL. 
Brainstorming CAD:

After defining our list of constraints, which included: 
- Chassis out of UMHW (Side) and Nylon (Back)
- 4WD, Direct Drive Rear Drive + Belted Dead Shaft Front Drive
- Belted Weapon Drive, Asymmetrical Single Toothed Weapon
- Swappable Wedge and Forks for fights
- CF Top and Bottom Plates 

We have yet to decide: 
- Weapon Motor
- Drive Motor (Used JCR Modified Dartbox Pro (Viper) as an example) 
- Buy Pre-cut or Machine Ourselves (Whichever is cheaper)

CAD Progress: 
- Incomplete Chassis and Uprights

Note: 
Both of us worked 4.5 hours 


  

## 11/3/2025 12 AM - Finished Wheels, Designed Bottom Plate, Adjusted Upright  

I spent today largely finishing the drive system of the robot, with some of my efforts directed towards adjusting the Uprights to fit the Dartbox Pro Motors. 

Chassis (Material - ?):
- Adjusted Connecting Parts to add space for forks

Uprights (UHMW) 
- Adjusted Part Lighten to have space for motor to fit through
- Added 8-32 clearance holes on the bottom for eventual use in mounting the bottom plate with a nut
- Defined UMHW as material for its favorable properties over other plastics

Wheels (TPU + Casted Rubber)
- Defined using casting rubber for wheel grip (I own some)
- Modeled belt and pulley GT2-3M connection and defined it in assembly 
- Using Pololu Wheel Hub Mount for rear drive and a needle bearing for front wheels


Progress for Today:

## 11/3/2025 11 PM - Designed Forks V1, Drafted Wheel Guards, Added Inserts  

Today I focused on designing the forks for the robot. I wanted to knock these out so that I could adjust the wedge tomorrow. I also mocked up wheel guards in Microsoft Whiteboard, which will preferably be made out of TPU. Then I added some bolts and threaded inserts (added them to the BOM as well) to make the CAD more accurate to the actual design. Finally, I added some relations to my assembly to add some accurate animations to the robot. Hoping my partner and I will be able to finish the uprights and weapon system by Thursday. 

Minimal Changes:
- CF Nylon is being considered for the Side Chassis to be able to be used with heat set inserts 
- Changed connecting part angle from 60 deg to 45 deg to account for wedge optimal angle

## 11/5/2025 - Wedge   

Designed Wedge and prepared DXF.
Will order this from Send Cut Send 
Started work on top plate as well. 

Planning to reinforce the wedge mounting wise and mount the top plate.
