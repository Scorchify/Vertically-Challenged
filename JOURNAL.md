## 11/2/2025 - Brainstormed + Designed Chassis (2/3 done)   

My partner and I started by developing a "brain-dump," which resulted in an incomplete CAD which laid out the foundation for what we wanted to make. We were heavily inspired by "Blink," a 3lb robot that has fought at NHRL. 
Brainstorming CAD:

After defining our list of constraints, which included: 
- Chassis out of UMHW (Side) and Nylon (Back)
- 4WD, Direct Drive Rear Drive + Belted Dead Shaft Front Drive
- Belted Weapon Drive, Asymmetrical Single Toothed Weapon
- Swappable Wedge and Forks for fights
- CF Top and Bottom Plates 

We have yet to decide: 
- Weapon Motor
- Drive Motor (Used JCR Modified Dartbox Pro (Viper) as an example) 
- Buy Pre-cut or Machine Ourselves (Whichever is cheaper)

CAD Progress: 
- Incomplete Chassis and Uprights

Note: 
Both of us worked 4.5 hours 


  

## 11/3/2025 - Finished Wheels, Designed Bottom Plate, Adjusted Upright  

I spent today largely finishing the drive system of the robot, with some of my efforts directed towards adjusting the Uprights to fit the Dartbox Pro Motors. 

Chassis (Material - ?):
- Adjusted Connecting Parts to add space for forks

Uprights (UHMW) 
- Adjusted Part Lighten to have space for motor to fit through
- Added 8-32 clearance holes on the bottom for eventual use in mounting the bottom plate with a nut
- Defined UMHW as material for its favorable properties over other plastics

Wheels (TPU + Casted Rubber)
- Defined using casting rubber for wheel grip (I own some)
- Modeled belt and pulley GT2-3M connection and defined it in assembly 
- Using Pololu Wheel Hub Mount for rear drive and a needle bearing for front wheels


Progress for Today:
