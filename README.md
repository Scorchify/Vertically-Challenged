Our project is a 3-pound combat robot built for fierce competition at NHRL and other combat robotics events. It boasts a powerful vertical spinner as its main weapon, along with a robust wedge and cleverly positioned forks to help control the action and outsmart opponents. Designed for durability, precision, and top-notch performance, this robot is all about delivering reliability and a serious punch in the arena.

We kicked off this project as part of our combat robotics club, building on the skills and teamwork we honed while working on smaller 150-gram robots. This 3-pound robot marks our first venture into a heavier weight class, allowing us to put our knowledge to the test and push ourselves with new design, engineering, and fabrication techniques. It’s not just a project; it’s a valuable learning experience and a significant milestone in our journey through the exciting world of combat robotics.
