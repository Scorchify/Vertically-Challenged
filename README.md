Our project showcases a 3-pound combat robot that's ready to take on tough competition at NHRL and other combat robotics events. It's armed with a powerful vertical spinner as its main weapon, along with a  wedge and forks to help control the action and beat other robots. 

We kicked off this project as part of our combat robotics club, building on the skills we gained while working on smaller 150-gram robots. This 3-pound robot marks our first venture into a heavier weight class, allowing us to put our knowledge to the test.
