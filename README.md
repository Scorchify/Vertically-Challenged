Calctastrophe is our 3lb double vertical spinner built for NHRL and other combat robotics events. It runs two belt-driven vertical spinners that reach nearly 20,000 RPM, supported by a high-angled defensive wedge and forks that help us stay in control during engagements. For drive, we use a four-wheel belted system powered by brushed Dartbox Pro (Viper) motors, giving us solid pushing power and reliability around the arena.


## 🛠 Design Approach

This is our first build in the beetleweight class after spending time designing and building with fairyweight robots. A major focus for this robot was designing something we could realistically manufacture within our school’s Computer Integrated Manufacturing class. With the exception of the AR500 weapon, all of the major components were designed to be made using the tools we have access to, including the waterjet, CNC mill, and 3D printers. 


## 🧩 Materials

We tried to balance competitive performance, durability, and cost while staying within our school’s manufacturing capabilities:

- **AR500** – Weapon  
- **6061 Aluminum** – Forks  
- **5052 Aluminum** – Wedge  
- **CF Nylon** – Frame and other complex 3D printed parts  
- **TPU** – Wheel guards and wheel hubs for impact absorption  
- **UHMW** – Uprights  

This combination let us experiment with more ambitious designs while gaining experience working with diverse machines and materials.


## ⚙ Drive & Weapons

The robot’s twin belt-driven vertical spinners provide the main offensive power, while the high defensive wedge helps us survive big hits and stay in control of engagements. The four-wheel belt drive offers consistent traction and good handling, and the brushed Dartbox Pro motors provide a solid balance of torque and reliability for the weight class.

## 🎯 Why We Designed Calctastrophe

As President and Vice-President of our school’s combat robotics club, we wanted to build something that would inspire others to take on ambitious projects of their own. With Calctastrophe, our goal was to prove that a competitive beetleweight could be built primarily with materials and machines available to students. We didn’t just want to compete for ourselves—we also wanted to encourage other club members to push their designs further and make the most of the resources we have.
